## Welcome! 👋

This BrickBot organization contains projects related to the original Lego MindStorms set—the Lego MindStorms RCX!

A hacker community grew around the RCX—individuals intrigued by the capabilities and determined to push the limits of what was possible.
Of a time before GitHub came to prominence as site for sharing open source projects, many of these RCX projects were scattered
on various personal and univeristy websites across the Internet.

A number of these projects have otherwise disappeared from the Internet, while others languished in deprecated version control systems 
or could only be found by looking up the website on an Internet archive.
A few were projects that had been downloaded and saved before the original web pages disappeared,
but whereever and whenever possible, links to either the original website (if still active) or an Internet archive version (if available) have been included.

Despite these efforts, several projects are known to have slipped through the cracks.  If anyone might still have a copy of these,
the contribution of that code would be most welcome.

Projects imported to this GitHub organization have been curated to varying degrees as part of the import process.
Please feel free to join and contribute in whatever way you can, whether that might be cleaning up or updating documenation,
onverting text files to Markdown, setting up wikis, or updating code to work with the latest host platforms.

The initial seventy-plus (70+) projects gathered under this BrickBot organization on GitHub were largely collected by Matthew Sheets.
